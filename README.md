# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Jorge 

I'm a Frontend Engineer with 5+ years of experience building high-performance, user-friendly web applications using modern tools like **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Express.js**.

I specialize in creating fast, scalable, and maintainable interfaces, with a strong focus on performance optimization and UX. I've developed:

- Internal tools that automated workflows and reduced operational costs
- Dynamic landing page systems powered by CMS integrations for marketing teams
- Component libraries that boosted cross-team development speed and consistency
- A marketplace platform for a Proptech company, used by users across LATAM
- International e-commerce platforms with full-featured shopping experiences

I care deeply about writing clean, modular code, building for scalability, and collaborating across teams to solve real-world problems with well-crafted software.

### ðŸ“š Currently exploring

I'm expanding my skill set beyond frontend development, focusing on **backend technologies** like Express, PostgreSQL, and serverless architecture. My goal is to transition toward a more **fullstack** role where I can deliver complete, end-to-end solutions.
